    steps:
      # At Baseflow, we mark issues with the `status: needs more info` label when more information is
      # required to be able to solve an issue. When nobody (either original poster or other community 
      # members) respond to the issue within 14 days the issue will be closed.
      #
      # To automate this process we utilize the [stale](https://github.com/actions/stale) GitHub action.
      # However the [stale](https://github.com/actions/stale) action requires an issue to be marked specifically
      # as "stale" before it will consider an issue to be closed. Therefore we utilize the following 
      # configuration:
      # 1. Set the `stale-issue-label` parameter to `status: needs more info`. This will inform the stale action that all 
      # issues marked with this particular label to be stale (note that Baseflow manually adds this label after initial triaging).
      # 2. Set the `days-before-stale` parameter to `-1`. This will prevent the [stale](https://github.com/actions/stale) action 
      # from automatically marking issues as being "stale". As mentioned in step 1, at Baseflow we want to manually 
      # triage the issue and mark it to require more information.
      # 3. Set the `close-issue-label` parameter to `status: closed (missing info)` to easily allow us to track issues closed due 
      # to a lack of information.
      # issue is closed. This will make sure the label is automatically removed when the issue is re-opened (most likely
      # this happend because someone added more information).
      # 4. Set the `days-before-close` parameter to `14` to indicate after how many days, since marking the issue with
      # the `status: needs more info` label, the issue should be closed automatically.
      # 5. Set the `close-issue-message` parameter with a text that will be placed as a comment to the respective issue that
      # is closed to explain why the issue was closed.
