# Contributing to the Flutter Permission handler plugin

## What you will need

* A Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows machine (note: to run and compile iOS-specific parts you'll need access to a Mac OS X machine);
* git (used for source version control, installation instructions can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/));
* The Flutter SDK (installation instructions can be found [here](https://flutter.io/get-started/install/));
* A personal GitHub account (if you don't have one, you can sign up for free [here](https://github.com/))

## Setting up your development environment

* Fork `https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter-permission-handler` into your own GitHub account. If you already have a fork and moving to a new computer, make sure you update your fork.
* If you haven't configured your machine with an SSH key that's known to GitHub, then
  follow [GitHub's directions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)
  to generate an SSH key.
* Clone your forked repo on your local development machine: `git clone git@github.com:<your_name_here>/flutter-permission-handler.git`
* Change into the `flutter-permission-handler` directory: `cd flutter-permission-handler`
* Add an upstream to the original repo, so that fetches from the master repository and not your clone: `git remote add upstream git@github.com:Baseflow/flutter-permission-handler.git`

## Running the example project

* Change into the example directory: `cd example`
* Run the App: `flutter run`
